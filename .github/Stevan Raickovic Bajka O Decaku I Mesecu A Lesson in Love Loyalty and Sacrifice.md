The story begins with a rumor that some people have managed to climb to the moon. This news intrigues only one boy from a small village, who lives in the seventh house. He starts to observe the moon every night, noticing its spots and imagining that they are footprints of those who have been there. He also sees the moon hanging on the branches of trees and decides to follow it.
  
The boy climbs a tree, but the moon moves away. He runs after it, but it always escapes him. He tries to reach it by climbing a hill, a mountain, and even a cloud, but he never succeeds.
