One of the most popular features of Sonic Generations is the ability to install mods, which are fan-made modifications that add new content or change existing aspects of the game. Mods can range from simple cosmetic changes, such as new character models or music, to more complex gameplay alterations, such as new levels or abilities.
 
One of the most requested mods for Sonic Generations is the Sonic Generations Blaze Mod, which lets players play as Blaze the Cat, a female cat-like character who debuted in Sonic Rush (2005). Blaze is from an alternate dimension where she is the guardian of the Sol Emeralds, which are similar to the Chaos Emeralds. She has pyrokinetic powers that allow her to manipulate fire and fly. She is also a close friend and rival of Sonic.
 
## What is the Sonic Generations Blaze Mod?
 
The Sonic Generations Blaze Mod is a mod that replaces Sonic with Blaze in both Classic and Modern gameplay modes. The mod was created by Bandi, a modder who also made other character mods for Sonic Generations, such as Shadow, Silver, and Amy. The mod was first released in 2013 and has been updated several times since then.
 
The mod features several changes to make Blaze fit into the game, such as:
 
- A new physics set that makes Blaze slightly slower than Sonic, but more agile and aerial. She can perform a double jump, a flaming spiral attack, and a hover dash.
- A new voice pack that uses Blaze's voice clips from Sonic Rush and Sonic Colors.
- A new animation set that makes Blaze move more naturally and expressively.
- A new model that resembles Blaze's appearance in Sonic Rush and Sonic Colors.
- A new HUD that displays Blaze's portrait and name.
- A new rival battle that pits Blaze against Sonic instead of Shadow.

The mod also includes optional add-ons that enhance the experience, such as:

- A Sir Percival skin that makes Blaze look like her knightly alter ego from Sonic and the Black Knight (2009).
- A Water Palace stage that recreates Blaze's first level from Sonic Rush.
- A Camelot Castle stage that recreates one of Blaze's levels from Sonic and the Black Knight.
