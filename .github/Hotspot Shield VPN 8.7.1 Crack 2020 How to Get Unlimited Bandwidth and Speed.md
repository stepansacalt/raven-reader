VBA Password Recovery Master 2.0 is a software tool that can help you recover lost or forgotten passwords for VBA projects in Microsoft Office applications. VBA projects are macros or scripts that automate tasks or enhance functionality in Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook. If you have locked your VBA projects with a password and forgot it, you may not be able to access or modify your code.
 
Fortunately, VBA Password Recovery Master 2.0 can help you solve this problem. It can quickly and easily restore passwords to VBA modules in any DOC, DOT, DOCM, DOTM, XLS, XLA, XLT, XLSM, XLAM, XLTM, XLSB, PPTM, POTM, PPAM, PPSM or OTM file. It works by swapping the memory of the original function used to display the password dialog box with a user defined function that will always return 1 when being called. This way, the VBE (Visual Basic Editor) will \"think\" that the password is right and open the locked VBA project.
