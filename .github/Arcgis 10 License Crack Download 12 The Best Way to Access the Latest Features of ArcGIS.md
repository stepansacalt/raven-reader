## What's New in ArcGIS 10.7
 
ArcGIS 10.7 introduces new features and capabilities that enhance the functionality and performance of the GIS software. Here are some of the highlights of what's new in ArcGIS 10.7:

- A new analysis environment setting, the Cell Size Projection Method, is available for the majority of tools in the Raster Interpolation, Math, Reclass, and Surface toolsets. This setting determines how the output raster cell size will be calculated when datasets are projected during analysis. The default method, Convert units, is equivalent to the method used in previous releases. Two additional methods, Preserve resolution and Center of extent, are now available.
- You can no longer create user-schema geodatabases in Oracle. You can continue to use and upgrade existing user-schema geodatabases at this release, but you should begin moving your data to stand-alone geodatabases.
- The â+â and â-â operators are added to the Function evaluator. These operators can be used when setting up a function evaluator on a network dataset.
- ArcMap 10.7 introduces new features and capabilities in mapping, geocoding, and the ArcGIS Network Analyst extension. For example, you can now create map books with multiple data frames per page, use a new geocoding service that supports multiple languages and address formats, and perform network analysis on multimodal networks with time-dependent attributes.
- ArcGIS Pro 2.3 is also included in the ArcGIS 10.7 installation package. ArcGIS Pro is a modern, powerful, and user-friendly GIS application that supports both 2D and 3D visualization and analysis. ArcGIS Pro 2.3 offers new features and enhancements such as improved editing tools, support for utility networks and trace networks, integration with ArcGIS Image Server, and more.
