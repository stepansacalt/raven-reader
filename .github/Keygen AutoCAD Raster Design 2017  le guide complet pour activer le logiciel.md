AutoCAD Raster Design 2017 is a specialized toolset that is included with AutoCAD 2017. It allows you to access tools to enhance image editing and cleanup, edit raster entities using standard AutoCAD commands, and simplify your workflows with vectorization tools. You can also show and analyze geo images in Civil 3D and AutoCAD Map 3D. In this article, we will show you how to use some of the features of AutoCAD Raster Design 2017 to improve your productivity and accuracy when working with raster data.
 
## Image Editing and Cleanup
 
One of the first steps when working with scanned drawings or raster images is to improve their quality and clarity. AutoCAD Raster Design 2017 provides a range of tools to help you despeckle, bias, mirror, and touch up your images. You can access these tools from the Image ribbon tab or the Image menu.
 
For example, you can use the Despeckle tool to remove unwanted noise or specks from your image. You can adjust the size and intensity of the despeckle filter to suit your needs. You can also use the Image Adjust tool to change the brightness, contrast, and gamma of your image. This can help you enhance the visibility of your image and make it easier to work with.

## Raster Entity Manipulation (REM)
 
Another useful feature of AutoCAD Raster Design 2017 is the ability to edit raster entities using standard AutoCAD commands. Raster entities are objects that are recognized by AutoCAD Raster Design as lines, arcs, circles, text, or regions. You can use the REM tools to select, move, copy, rotate, scale, trim, extend, erase, or snap to raster entities as if they were vector objects.
 
You can access the REM tools from the Raster ribbon tab or the Raster menu. For example, you can use the Raster Selection tool to select one or more raster entities by windowing or crossing. You can then use any of the standard AutoCAD modify commands to manipulate them. You can also use the Raster Snap tool to snap to raster entities when drawing new vector objects.
 
## Vectorization Tools
 
The ultimate goal when working with scanned drawings or raster images is often to convert them to vector objects that can be edited and manipulated in AutoCAD. AutoCAD Raster Design 2017 offers several vectorization tools that can help you automate this process and save time.
 
You can access the vectorization tools from the Vectorization ribbon tab or the Vectorization menu. For example, you can use the OCR tool to recognize text in your image and convert it to editable MTEXT objects. You can adjust the OCR settings to match the font, size, and orientation of your text. You can also use the Vectorization tool to create lines and polylines from raster images. You can choose from different vectorization methods depending on the type and quality of your image.
 
## Image Transformation Functionality
 
If you work with geo images such as aerial photos or satellite images, you may want to show and analyze them in Civil 3D or AutoCAD Map 3D. AutoCAD Raster Design 2017 allows you to do that by providing image transformation functionality.
 
You can access this functionality from the Georeference ribbon tab or the Georeference menu. For example, you can use the Insert Geo Image tool to insert a geo image into your drawing and align it with your coordinate system. You can also use the Geo Image Manager tool to manage multiple geo images in your drawing.
 
## Conclusion
 
AutoCAD Raster Design 2017 is a powerful toolset that can help you work faster and more efficiently with raster data in Auto
