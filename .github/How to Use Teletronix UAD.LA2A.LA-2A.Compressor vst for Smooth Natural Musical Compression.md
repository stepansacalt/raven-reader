The Teletronix UAD LA-2A Compressor VST is part of the Teletronix LA-2A Leveler Collection, which features three different versions of the LA-2A plugin, each with its own distinctive sonic attributes. The collection includes the LA-2A Silver, the LA-2A Gray, and the original LA-2 model. The LA-2A Silver is based on a late-1960s version of the hardware, manufactured by Universal Audio founder Bill Putnam. It has a fast time constant and a wide range of compression settings, making it suitable for transient-rich sources like drums and percussion. The LA-2A Gray is based on a mid-1960s version of the hardware, designed by Teletronix founder Jim Lawrence. It has a more average time constant and a more gentle compression curve, making it ideal for vocals, bass, and guitars. The LA-2 model is based on a rare early 1960s version of the hardware, which has a slow response and a unique "mellowed" sound due to 50 years of luminescent panel aging.
 
The Teletronix UAD LA-2A Compressor VST plugin is compatible with both Mac and PC platforms, and can run natively on your DAW or accelerated on Apollo interfaces and UAD-2 hardware. It has a simple and intuitive interface, with only two main controls: Peak Reduction and Gain. The Peak Reduction knob adjusts the amount of compression applied to the signal, while the Gain knob compensates for the output level. The plugin also has a switch to select between Limit and Compress modes, as well as a meter to monitor the gain reduction or output level. The plugin also comes with presets from LA-2A users such as Ross Hogarth, Darrell Thorp, and Vance Powell.
 
The Teletronix UAD LA-2A Compressor VST plugin is a great way to add some vintage warmth, smoothness, and character to your digital audio productions. Whether you want to tame some harsh peaks, add some glue to your mix, or enhance some vocals or instruments, you can rely on this classic optical compressor to do the job. You can try it for free for 14 days and see if it's right for you.

A general rule of thumb for using the LA-2A plugin is to start with both knobs at zero and then increase the Peak Reduction until you see some gain reduction on the meter. You can also use your ears to listen for how much compression you want to apply. Then, adjust the Gain knob to bring back some of the lost level. You can also use the Gain knob to boost or attenuate the signal as needed. You can switch between Limit and Compress modes to change the compression ratio and knee. Limit mode has a higher ratio and a harder knee, which means more compression and less dynamic range. Compress mode has a lower ratio and a softer knee, which means less compression and more dynamic range.
 
The beauty of the LA-2A plugin is that it does not have any other controls like attack, release, or ratio. The plugin automatically adjusts these parameters based on the input signal and the Peak Reduction setting. This makes it very easy to use and also very musical and transparent. The plugin also adds some subtle tube saturation and harmonic distortion to the signal, which enhances its warmth and character.
 
Here are some examples of how you can use the LA-2A plugin on different sources:
 
- Vocals: The LA-2A plugin is great for vocals because it can smooth out any harsh peaks or sibilance without affecting the natural tone or expression of the singer. You can use either the LA-2A Gray or Silver model for vocals, depending on how fast or slow you want the compression to be. You can also use Limit mode for more aggressive vocals or Compress mode for more subtle vocals.
- Bass: The LA-2A plugin can also add some punch and presence to bass tracks by controlling their dynamics and adding some tube warmth. You can use either the LA-2A Silver or Gray model for bass, depending on how much transient response you want to preserve or reduce. You can also use Limit mode for more tightness or Compress mode for more roundness.
- Drums: The LA-2A plugin can be used on individual drum tracks or drum buses to add some snap and glue to them. You can use either the LA-2A Silver or Gray model for drums, depending on how much attack or sustain you want to emphasize or attenuate. You can also use Limit mode for more punch or Compress mode for more groove.
- Guitars: The LA-2A plugin can be used on acoustic or electric guitars to smooth out their dynamics and add some sparkle and richness. You can use either the LA-2A Gray or Silver model for guitars, depending on how much brightness or warmth you want to add or subtract. You can also use Limit mode 8cf37b1e13
