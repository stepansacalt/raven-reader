In this article, we will show you how to download and install Windows Server 2012 R2 in a compressed format using the following steps:
  
1. Download the Windows Server 2012 R2 ISO file from the Microsoft Evaluation Center. You can choose from different languages and editions, such as Standard or Datacenter. The ISO file size is about 4.3 GB.
2. Download a compression tool that can create and extract ZIP files, such as 7-Zip or WinRAR. You can use any compression tool that supports ZIP format, but we will use 7-Zip as an example.
3. Right-click on the Windows Server 2012 R2 ISO file and select 7-Zip > Add to archive. In the Add to Archive window, choose ZIP as the archive format and set the compression level to Ultra. You can also change the archive name and password if you want. Click OK to start compressing the ISO file. The compression process may take some time depending on your computer's performance and the compression level. The compressed ZIP file size should be around 3 GB.
4. Copy the compressed ZIP file to a USB flash drive or an external hard drive that has enough space. You can also upload the compressed ZIP file to a cloud storage service, such as OneDrive or Google Drive, if you want to access it from another computer.
5. Connect the USB flash drive or the external hard drive to the computer where you want to install Windows Server 2012 R2. Alternatively, download the compressed ZIP file from the cloud storage service if you uploaded it there.
6. Right-click on the compressed ZIP file and select 7-Zip > Extract Here. This will extract the ISO file from the ZIP file to the same location. The extraction process may take some time depending on your computer's performance and the size of the ISO file.
7. Right-click on the extracted ISO file and select Mount. This will mount the ISO file as a virtual DVD drive on your computer. You can also use a third-party tool, such as Daemon Tools or Virtual CloneDrive, to mount the ISO file if your computer does not support this feature.
8. Open the virtual DVD drive and run Setup.exe to start the installation of Windows Server 2012 R2. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. You can choose to upgrade your existing operating system or perform a clean installation.
