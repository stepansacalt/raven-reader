## What Makes Ciudad De Dios So Unique and Powerful?
 
One of the most remarkable aspects of Ciudad De Dios is its use of non-professional actors, mostly from the actual Cidade de Deus neighborhood. The directors held auditions for over 2,000 children and teenagers from the slums, and selected about 200 of them to participate in a four-month acting workshop. The workshop helped the actors to develop their characters and improvise their dialogues, as well as to bond with each other and the directors. The result was a natural and authentic performance that captured the essence and emotions of the characters.
 
Another element that sets Ciudad De Dios apart from other films is its innovative and dynamic style of cinematography and editing. The film uses a variety of techniques, such as handheld cameras, fast cuts, freeze frames, voice-overs, flashbacks, flash-forwards and split screens, to create a fast-paced and immersive experience that reflects the chaotic and unpredictable nature of the favela. The film also employs a nonlinear narrative structure that jumps back and forth in time, showing different perspectives and events that are interconnected and affect each other. The film thus creates a complex and rich mosaic of stories and characters that form a collective portrait of the City of God.
 
Finally, Ciudad De Dios is a film that does not shy away from showing the harsh and brutal reality of life in the slums, but also does not romanticize or glorify it. The film exposes the social and economic factors that drive many young people to join the drug trade and the violence that ensues from it. The film also shows the lack of opportunities, education, health care and justice that plague the favela residents. The film does not offer easy solutions or moral judgments, but rather invites the audience to witness and reflect on the human condition in a context of extreme poverty and inequality.
