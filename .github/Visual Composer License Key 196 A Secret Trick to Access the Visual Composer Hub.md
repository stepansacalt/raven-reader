- Next, you will see the Visual Composer editor. It has two modes: frontend and backend. The frontend mode allows you to edit your page directly on the live site, while the backend mode allows you to edit your page in a grid layout. You can switch between the modes by clicking on the icons at the bottom left corner of the editor.
- Then, you can start adding elements to your page. Elements are the building blocks of your website. They can be text, images, buttons, icons, sliders, maps, and more. To add an element, click on the "+" icon at the top left corner of the editor. You will see a list of elements categorized by type. You can also search for an element by name or keyword.
- After you add an element, you can customize it by clicking on the pencil icon. You will see a popup window with various options and settings. You can change the content, style, layout, animation, and more of your element. You can also drag and drop your element to change its position or resize it by pulling its corners.
- Besides elements, you can also add templates and extensions to your page. Templates are pre-designed layouts that you can insert into your page with one click. Extensions are additional features that enhance the functionality of your website. To add a template or an extension, click on the "Hub" icon at the top right corner of the editor. You will see a library of templates and extensions that you can download from the Visual Composer Hub.
- Finally, you can preview and publish your page. To preview your page, click on the eye icon at the bottom right corner of the editor. You will see how your page looks like on different devices and screen sizes. To publish your page, click on the "Update" or "Publish" button at the top right corner of the editor.

That's it! You have just created a stunning website with Visual Composer Premium using license key 196. I hope you enjoy using Visual Composer and create more amazing websites in the future.
