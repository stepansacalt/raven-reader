# ChemOffice Professional 15: A Complete Suite of Scientific Tools for Chemistry and Biology
 
ChemOffice Professional 15 is a software package that provides a comprehensive set of tools for chemists and biologists to capture, store, retrieve, analyze, and share data and information on compounds, reactions, materials, and their properties. ChemOffice Professional 15 includes the following applications:
 
- ChemDraw Professional: The industry standard for drawing chemical structures and reactions, with features such as enhanced hotkeys, biomolecule support, document tagging, and ChemDraw Cloud.
- ChemDraw for Excel: An add-in that allows you to create and manipulate chemical structures and data in Excel spreadsheets.
- Chem3D: A powerful molecular modeling and visualization tool that enables you to generate 3D models of molecules and assess their shape and properties.
- ChemFinder Ultra: A database management system that allows you to organize and search your chemical information by structure, substructure, name, formula, property, or text.
- ChemFinder for Office: An add-in that allows you to access your ChemFinder databases from Word, PowerPoint, or Outlook.
- ChemScript: A scripting language that allows you to automate tasks and calculations involving chemical structures and data.
- Mnova ChemDraw Edition: A software for processing and analyzing 1D NMR and LC/GC/MS data directly on your desktop.
- PerkinElmer Signals Notebook Individual Edition: A cloud-based electronic lab notebook that allows you to capture and share your research work and material evidence online.

ChemOffice Professional 15 is designed to help scientists in their research by enabling them to efficiently search scientific databases, gain a deeper understanding of their data, correlate biological activity and other properties with chemical structures, and produce publication-ready scientific reports. ChemOffice Professional 15 is also very helpful in documenting chemical processes and drug substances for regulatory and patent filings. This innovative suite makes drawing correct and chemically intelligent structures and synthetic schemes intuitively easy.
