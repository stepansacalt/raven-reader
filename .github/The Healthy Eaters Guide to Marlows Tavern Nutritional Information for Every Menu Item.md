## Calories and Macros
 
One of the first things you might want to know is how many calories and macronutrients (carbs, fat, and protein) are in your meal. This can help you plan your daily intake and balance your diet. Here are some examples of the calories and macros of some Marlow's Tavern dishes:
 
- Salmon and Couscous: 675 calories, 32 g carbs, 32 g fat, 40 g protein
- Chicken Panni with Grilled Chicken, Spinach, Mozzarella, Tomato: 700 calories, 50 g carbs, 40 g fat, 45 g protein
- Tavern House Salad: 550 calories, 4 g carbs, 10 g fat, 18 g protein
- Tavern Rice (side): 200 calories, 44 g carbs, 1 g fat, 5 g protein
- Honey Roasted Peanuts (snack): 160 calories, 8 g carbs, 20 g fat, 7 g protein

As you can see, some dishes are higher in calories and fat than others, while some are lower in carbs and higher in protein. Depending on your goals and preferences, you might want to choose dishes that suit your needs. For example, if you are following a low-carb diet, you might want to avoid the couscous and rice and opt for salads or grilled meats instead. If you are looking for more protein, you might want to add some nuts or cheese to your salad or sandwich.
  
## Fiber and Sugar
 
Another thing you might want to know is how much fiber and sugar are in your meal. Fiber is important for digestion and can help you feel fuller for longer. Sugar can provide energy but can also spike your blood sugar levels and lead to cravings. Here are some examples of the fiber and sugar content of some Marlow's Tavern dishes:

- Salmon and Couscous: 7 g fiber, unknown sugar
- Chicken Panni with Grilled Chicken, Spinach, Mozzarella, Tomato: unknown fiber, unknown sugar
- Tavern House Salad: unknown fiber, unknown sugar
- Tavern Rice (side): unknown fiber, unknown sugar
- Honey Roasted Peanuts (snack): unknown fiber, unknown sugar

As you can see, the fiber and sugar information is not available for most of the dishes. This makes it hard to estimate how filling or satisfying they are. However, based on the ingredients, we can assume that dishes that contain whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, or seeds will have more fiber than those that don't. Similarly, dishes that contain sauces, dressings, marinades, or sweeteners will have more sugar than those that don't. You might want to ask for these items on the side or skip them altogether if you are watching your sugar intake.
  
## Sodium and Cholesterol
 
The last thing you might want to know is how much sodium and cholesterol are in your meal. Sodium is essential for fluid balance and nerve function but can also raise your blood pressure if consumed in excess. Cholesterol is a type of fat that is needed for hormone production and cell function but can also clog your arteries if consumed in excess. Here are some examples of the sodium and cholesterol content of some Marlow's Tavern dishes:
