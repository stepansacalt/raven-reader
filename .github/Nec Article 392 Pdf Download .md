# Article 392: Cable Trays
 
Cable trays are a type of support system for electrical wiring that can be used for various purposes, such as service conductors, feeders, branch circuits, communications circuits, control circuits, and signaling circuits. Cable trays are not limited to industrial establishments and can be installed in any location where the wiring methods and cable types are permitted by the National Electrical Code (NEC).
 
Cable trays can be made of metal or nonmetallic materials and can have different shapes and sizes, such as ladder, ventilated trough, ventilated channel, solid bottom, and other similar structures. Cable trays and their associated fittings must be identified for the intended use and must provide electrical continuity and adequate support for the cables.

Some of the benefits of using cable trays are safety, dependability, space savings, and cost savings. Cable trays can provide a safe and reliable wiring system that can withstand harsh environments, such as high temperatures, humidity, corrosion, vibration, and electromagnetic interference. Cable trays can also reduce the risk of fire hazards and electrical shocks by providing adequate ventilation and separation for the cables.
 
Cable trays can also offer flexibility and adaptability for the wiring system. Cable trays can accommodate different types and sizes of cables and can be easily modified or expanded to meet changing needs. Cable trays can also simplify the installation and maintenance of the wiring system by allowing easy access and identification of the cables.
 
Cable trays can also help save space and money for the wiring system. Cable trays can reduce the amount of conduit and raceway needed for the wiring system and can optimize the use of available space. Cable trays can also lower the material and labor costs for the wiring system by reducing the number of fittings, supports, and splices required.

In conclusion, cable trays are a versatile and efficient support system for electrical wiring that can provide many advantages over other wiring methods. Cable trays can ensure safety, dependability, space savings, and cost savings for the wiring system and can comply with the NEC requirements for different applications and locations. Cable trays can also enhance the performance and aesthetics of the wiring system by providing a neat and organized arrangement of the cables.
