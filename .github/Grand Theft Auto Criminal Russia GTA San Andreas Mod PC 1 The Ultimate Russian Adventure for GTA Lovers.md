# Grand Theft Auto Criminal Russia: A Mod That Brings Russian Cities to GTA San Andreas
 
Grand Theft Auto Criminal Russia is a mod for GTA San Andreas that adds five new Russian cities to the game, each with its own storyline, atmosphere and features. The mod was created by a team of five modding groups, who revived the original Criminal Russia mod from 2006 and developed it further.
 
The mod takes place in 2008, and follows the protagonist Alexander (nicknamed Sly), who gets involved in the criminal history of Russia and tries to get out of it in the best traditions of GTA. The mod aims to create a realistic and detailed representation of Russia, with many new interactive elements, such as trains, trams, trolleybuses, shops, restaurants, banks, ATMs, gas stations, car dealerships and more.
