- Choose your starting location wisely. Different locations have different advantages and disadvantages, such as crime rates, drug prices, car availability, and police presence. For example, if you want to make money from drugs, you might want to start in Colombia or the Netherlands, where they are cheap and abundant. If you want to steal cars, you might want to start in Japan or Italy, where they are expensive and rare.
- Invest in your skills and attributes. As you level up, you can improve your skills and attributes, such as strength, intelligence, charisma, stealth, driving, shooting, and hacking. These will affect your performance in various activities, such as crimes, fights, car thefts, and missions. For example, if you want to be good at fighting, you might want to increase your strength and shooting skills.
- Join or create a family. A family is a group of players who work together and support each other. Being in a family can give you many benefits, such as protection, backup, resources, information, and reputation. You can join an existing family or create your own if you have enough money and influence. You can also form alliances or rivalries with other families.
- Be careful who you trust. Mobstar is a game of money, murder, and politics. You never know who might betray you or stab you in the back. Don't reveal too much information about yourself or your plans to anyone. Don't make enemies unnecessarily or provoke powerful players. Don't trust anyone blindly or expect loyalty from anyone.

Mobstar is a fun and challenging game that will test your skills and strategy as a mobster. If you follow these tips and tricks, you might have a chance to become the next Godfather. Good luck!
