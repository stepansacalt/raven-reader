- Check the comments section of the download page. Sometimes, the uploader or other users may share the password in the comments. Look for any clues or hints that may lead you to the password.
- Check the file name of the RAR archive. Sometimes, the password is hidden in the file name itself. For example, if the file name is "Mount.and.Blade.2.Bannerlord-CPY.rar", the password may be "CPY" or "cpy". Try different variations of capitalization and punctuation.
- Use a password cracker tool. There are some software programs that can attempt to crack the password of a RAR archive by using brute force or dictionary attacks. However, this method may take a long time and may not guarantee success. Some of these tools are also unsafe to use, as they may contain malware or viruses. Use them at your own risk.
- Download the game from a different source. If none of the above methods work, you may have to look for another download link that does not require a password. Alternatively, you can buy the game from a legitimate source, such as Steam or GOG.com. This way, you can support the developers and enjoy the game without any hassle.
